/**
 * Marks a method for asynchronous execution.
 *
 * <p>Add this annotation to the method you want to execute asynchronously.
 * Methods of return type {@code void} and {@link java.util.concurrent.Future}
 * are supported. In the latter case, an actual asynchronous Future will be
 * returned, but the target method should return a temporary {@code Future}
 * that passes the value through as the return type needs to be the same.
 *
 * <p>Usage with other return types may cause unexpected behavior (because
 * {@code NULL} will always be returned).
 *
 * <p>Keep in mind that there is a limited number of threads working with
 * methods annotated with <code>@Async</code>. Thus, if one of your
 * methods keep a thread busy for a long time, others will wait. Try to
 * make all methods fast, when you annotate them with <code>@Async</code>.
